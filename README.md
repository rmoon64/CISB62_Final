# Project Name:Sentiment Analysis on Amazon Fine Food Reviews

## The 'Amazon Fine Food Reviews' from Kaggle is a complete dataset that has about 560,000 reviews, which we trim down to 50,000 reviews.

## The goal of the project is to recommend new products to someone who does reviews often (Chris), using RNN to perform sentiment analysis using only Amazon reviews as the model.

# This project utilized various deep learning techniques.

## The main tools used were RNN, TensorFlow V1, and hyperparameter tuning.

## First, I utilized a trimmed-down version of the data set with 50,000 reviews.

## Then, I used Matplotlib to plot the visualizations of important data, for example, the top 10 products with the most reviewers and the percentage of positive and negative reviews made by Chris.

## I then prepared the RNN with the LSTM model.

## This model was then fitted using six epochs and a batch size of twenty.

## This proved to be very beneficial, as the accuracy was extremely high at 0.9953 with a quite low loss of 0.0160.

## Next, I cleaned the data and defined the parameters and placeholders.

## Lastly, I got the scores and recommendations for Chris.
